Project Report: Customtkinter Voting System Application

Goal of the Project 

The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly voting system application using Python with the Customtkinter library. This application allows users to log in with different roles, choose candidates, and cast votes securely. The system is designed for easy administration of voting processes, allowing administrators to manage candidates and view voting results in real-time.

Significance of the Project 

The significance of this project lies in its ability to make the process of voting simple and easy within various settings, such as schools, small communities, or corporate environments. By digitizing the voting process, the application ensures transparency, accuracy, and security, significantly reducing the likelihood of fraudulent activities and human errors. The novel integration of Customtkinter provides a modern and customizable user interface, enhancing user experience and engagement.



Installation and Instructions to Use:

- Go to terminal located on the bottom left corner of Pycharm and pip install customtkinter and matplotlib to begin using program
- Login: Open the application and use the credentials provided (or register a new user) to log in with a role (User or Administrator).
- Vote: As a user, select a candidate from the list presented and click 'Vote' to register your choice.
- Admin Dashboard: As an administrator, view current vote counts(which can see graphically), manage user data, and access simulation features from the admin dashboard.

Discussion and Conclusions

The project successfully demonstrates the application of Python programming and GUI development skills in creating a functional voting system.

Limitations: Currently, the system does not support large-scale candidates data also the program does not allows the administrator to add a new candidate. It lacks advanced security features for public elections like email more verification method, also there is improvement part for the GUI so the user can have a better experience. 

Conclusions:
Your program adeptly employs various data structures, including dictionaries and lists, to efficiently manage user data, candidate information, and voting records. Dictionaries serve as an organized repository for key-value pairs, facilitating swift access to essential data such as usernames and passwords. Meanwhile, lists offer a flexible means of storing and manipulating collections of items, such as aggregating votes for each candidate.

The integration of merge sort underscores your program's commitment to efficient sorting methodologies. By implementing merge sort, your program ensures not only stable and reliable sorting but also scalability, enabling seamless handling of increasingly larger datasets. This algorithm's time complexity of O(n log n) underscores its efficiency, contributing significantly to the program's overall performance.

Your program's robustness is further reinforced through strategic error handling, employing try/except blocks to gracefully manage exceptions that may arise during file operations. By preemptively addressing potential errors, such as file not found exceptions, your program maintains stability and resilience, ensuring a seamless user experience.

A standout feature of your program is its innovative simulation methodology, which anticipates real-world scenarios and forecasts their potential impact on voting outcomes. By simulating events such as disease outbreaks or policy changes, your program provides valuable insights into how voting patterns might evolve under varying circumstances. This predictive modeling capability enhances the program's analytical depth, offering valuable perspectives on electoral dynamics and decision-making processes.
